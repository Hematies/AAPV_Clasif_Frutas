    "The particular quantized neural network (QNN) we will be targeting in this notebook is referred to as CNV-w1a1 and it classifies 32x32 RGB images into one of ten CIFAR-10 classes. All weights and activations in this network are quantized to bipolar values (either -1 or +1), with the exception of the input (which is RGB with 8 bits per channel) and the final output (which is 32-bit numbers). It first appeared in the original [FINN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07119) from ISFPGA'17 with the name CNV, as a variant of the binarized convolutional network from the [BinaryNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02830), in turn inspired by the VGG-11 topology which was the runner-up for the 2014 [ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge](http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/).\n",

    "\n",
    "In FINN, we implement convolutions with the *lowering* approach: we convert them to matrix-matrix multiply operations, where one of the matrices is generated by sliding a window over the input image. You can read more about the sliding window operator and how convolution lowering works [in this notebook](https://github.com/maltanar/qnn-inference-examples/blob/master/3-convolutional-binarized-gtsrb.ipynb). The streaming dataflow architecture we will end up with is going to look something like this figure from the [FINN-R paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04570):\n",
    "\n",
    "![](cnv-mp-fc.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how the convolution layer looks very similar to the fully connected one in terms of the matrix-vector-threshold unit (MVTU), but now the MVTU is preceded by a sliding window unit that produces the matrix from the input image. All of these building blocks, including the `MaxPool` layer you see in this figure, exist as templated Vivado HLS C++ functions in [finn-hlslib](https://github.com/Xilinx/finn-hlslib).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To target this kind of hardware architecture with our network we'll apply a convolution lowering transformation, in addition to streamlining. You may recall the *streamlining transformation* that we applied to the TFC-w1a1 network, which is a series of mathematical simplifications that allow us to get rid of floating point scaling operations by implementing few-bit activations as thresholding operations. **The current implementation of streamlining is highly network-specific and may not work for your network if its topology is very different than the example network here. We hope to rectify this in future releases.**"

    "Notice the additional `RemoveCNVtoFCFlatten` transformation that was not used for TFC-w1a1. In the last Netron visualization you may have noticed a `Reshape` operation towards the end of the network where the convolutional part of the network ends and the fully-connected layers started. That `Reshape` is essentialy a tensor flattening operation, which we can remove for the purposes of hardware implementation. We can examine the contents of the dataflow partition with Netron, and observe the `ConvolutionInputGenerator`, `StreamingFCLayer_Batch` and `StreamingMaxPool_Batch` nodes that implement the sliding window, matrix multiply and maxpool operations in hlslib. *Note that the StreamingFCLayer instances following the ConvolutionInputGenerator nodes are really implementing the convolutions, despite the name. The final three StreamingFCLayer instances implement actual FC layers.*"
